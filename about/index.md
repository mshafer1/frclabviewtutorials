### Purpose

This website was created for the express purpose of posting informative tutorials on the FRC control system programmed in LabVIEW. It is not intended to duplicate existing getting started guides, but to compliment them.

### Legal/Tracking/Privacy Policy

We use [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/){:target="_blank"} to track how well we're getting the word out.

**Data collected (and visible to admins) DOES NOT include:**

* Identifiable information
  * Such as specific IP addresses

**Data collected includes (but not limited to):**

* Size of browser window in pixels (so we can test to make sure the site displays correctly for all users)
* Browser used (not all browsers support all JavaScript, this helps us to test on what our readers are using)
* Session duration (time spent on the site at a time - giving us an idea of whether people are reading the articles, or using them for reference, etc.)
* Counts of repeat Vs. new users (so we can know if our articles are useful enough to come back)
* Referring site Vs. direct Vs. search traffic (so we can know what methods of spreading the word are working).

### Data deletion

Because the collected data is anonymized (by Google), **we are unable (at this time) to offer an option to delete data on a specific user**. If you wish to have us filter your useage out of our views, please use the email on the [contact us](/contact_us/) page to request this (please include the IP address you wish to have filtered).
